ChangeLog Notes:

1. Remove the need to put in vinegar quantity.  
  - This change is so that the vinegar quantity needed can be displayed, no need to enter how much you have.
  - In the bottom box, list out the diff units of measure or make it selectable to see how much in cups etc.

  Going to make some UI changes to this one.  After reviewing, the ability to put in the amount of vinegar that you have in, is unnecessary, all that you need is to be able to select the unit of measure that the output shows.  Vinegar acidity % should only be wide enough to hold up to 3 digits as it cant be more than 100%.  and it should be a counter with an increment and decrement arrows on the end of the input field.  The %acidity and the vinegar unit of measure could probably be placed on the same line.
